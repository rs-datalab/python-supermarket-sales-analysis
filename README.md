# Supermarket Sales EDA (Python)

## Overview
This project explores supermarket transaction data to understand profitability patterns and evaluate whether customer satisfaction (Rating) is related to gross income.

It includes:
- Data loading + inspection
- Data cleaning (duplicates + missing values)
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Time series aggregation by date
- Pairwise numeric relationships and correlation analysis
- A short written report for recruiters

## Dataset
Supermarket Sales (Kaggle): https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales  
Time: Jan–Mar 2019  
Branches: A/B/C

## Key Results (high level)
- Ratings are broadly uniform; no strong skew.
- Rating vs gross income: correlation ≈ -0.04 → no meaningful relationship.
- Branch C shows a slightly higher median gross income, but distributions overlap heavily.
- Payment method and gender show minimal differences in gross income distributions.
- Financial variables (Tax/Total/cogs/gross income) are highly correlated because they’re derived.

See the notebook for plots and supporting analysis.
